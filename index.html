					I'm 18 years old, and graduated from high school in 2020. I moved from Santa Monica, California to Woodinville, Washington right before I turned 13, and from Woodinville to Mill Creek about a year ago. I currently live with my mother in an apartment with one dog and one cat. I'm unemployed at the moment, but I'm hoping to dive into a career in web development after this course.

					Being as young as I am, I don't have any actual industry experience. However, I have been programming for a while. I took APCS and AdvProg at Woodinville High School, so I know Java pretty well. I also took a class at DigiPen through the WaNIC program that covered C and Unity/C#. My best languages are problem C# and Java, but I've tried out a few other languages and messed around with shaders. Most of my experience has been making standalone applications or games, so I don't know HTML, CSS, or SQL very well.
